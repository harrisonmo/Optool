# Optool
Optool is a tool for everbody to use Gaussian for computing chemistry easily.
The idea to make such a tool was firstly put out by mqk.
Code is firstly typed by mqk and syx.
We bilieve that not only DFT calculation, but also other solutions by computer will totally change the way we get known of chemistry.
We hope our programme can make sense to human society, even only a little bit.
